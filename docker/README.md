# Using Xcessiv via Docker

This directory contains a `Dockerfile` for Xcessiv to work regardless of platform.

## Install Docker

The first step is to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) for your operating system.

## Steps to use this image

First, you must run a Redis server that Xcessiv will be able to connect to. You can run the [Redis Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/) here if you want. Ensure that your Docker container will be able to communicate with the Redis server by properly configuring [container networking](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/). Additionally, here is a great [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24319662/from-inside-of-a-docker-container-how-do-i-connect-to-the-localhost-of-the-mach) that covers communication from within a Docker container.

Let's say you've figured that our Docker container will be able to communicate with Redis at `172.17.42.1:6379`.

To start Xcessiv with Redis at `172.17.42.1:6379`, simply run:

`$ docker run -P --name='xcessiv' reiinakano/xcessiv xcessiv -H "172.17.42.1" -P 6379`

The `-P` flag for Docker is used to expose port 1994 to the host, so you can use your web browser to interact with Xcessiv at `localhost:1994`.

### Mounting projects folder into container for persistence

To save any projects you make with Xcessiv, you'll want to mount your own project folder into the Xcessiv Docker container's project folder. To do this, run:

`$ docker run -P --name='xcessiv' -v /myxcessiv/XcessivProjects/:/XcessivProjects/ reiinakano/xcessiv`

where `/myxcessiv/XcessivProjects/` is the host directory you want to save projects to.

### Using your own configuration file

To start Xcessiv with your own configuration file, run:

`$ docker run -P --name='xcessiv' -v /myxcessiv/myconf/config.py:/root/.xcessiv/config.py reiinakano/xcessiv`

where `/myxcessiv/myconf/` is a local directory containing the `config.py` file you want to use.

## Use docker-compose

The simplest form to start Xcessiv is with docker-compose. This will start Redisi, Xcessiv and defines a shared data directory in `./data`. Simply type:
`$ docker-compose up`
